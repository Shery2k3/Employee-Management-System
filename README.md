# CSSE-405 Data Structures and Algorithms - Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the CSSE-405 Data Structures and Algorithms course. The project is a `Employee Management System` implemented in Java.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/Employee.java`: This file contains the `Employee` class, which represents an employee in the system. It includes fields for the employee's name, id, position, and salary, as well as a method to print the employee's details.

- `src/EmployeeManager.java`: This file contains the `EmployeeManager` class, which is responsible for managing `Employee` objects. It includes methods to add, remove, update, and retrieve employees.

- `src/EmployeeInterface.java`: This file contains the `EmployeeInterface` class, which provides the user interface for the application. It includes GUI components like text fields and buttons, as well as methods to handle button clicks and update the display.

- `src/Main.java`: This file contains the `Main` class, which is the entry point of the application. It creates an instance of `EmployeeInterface` and makes it visible.

## How to Run

To run the application, execute the `Main` class. This will start the application and display the user interface.
